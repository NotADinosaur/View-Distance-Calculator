# View-Distance-Calculator
A simple program written in python which calculates how far away from something you need to be to see it.

## Usage
<ins>command line:</ins> run `main.py -f [field of view in degrees] -r [radius of the area you want to view]`  
example: `main.py -f 85 -r 1024`  
use `-h` flag for help

<ins>gui:</ins> doesn't exist yet

## TODO
Note: Not in order of priority, will happen as I learn how to do these things
- add units
- support non-square field of view
- gui
- rounding
- provide as an exe
- I'm probably forgetting something
